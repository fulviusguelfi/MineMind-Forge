# MineMind Forge: Operator Manual

## Overview

This document serves as the official reference for operating AI Bots generated by MineMind Forge. These bots are designed to be autonomous but strictly loyal to their **Creator** (the operator who spawned them).

## Bot Archetypes

Bots can be assigned specific behavioral archetypes. This dictates their default state machine logic.

| Archetype | Description | Primary Goal |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Protector** | Heavily armed bodyguards. | Stay close to the creator; attack hostiles immediately. |
| **Explorer** | Pathfinding specialists. | Map out terrain; light up caves; report interesting finds. |
| **Builder** | Construction focused. | Gather resources; flatten terrain; assist with blueprints. |
| **Miner** | Subterranean specialists. | Optimized strip mining; torch placement; avoids lava. |
| **Farmer** | Agriculture specialists. | Tills soil; plants seeds; harvests crops; composts excess. |
| **Generalist** | Balanced AI. | Capable of switching between tasks moderately well. |

## Command Dictionary

Commands are issued via the in-game chat. 
**Note:** Bots verify the sender. Only the Creator can issue these commands.

### Command Syntax
All commands use the prefix `!`.
```
!command <arguments> [Target]
```

### Targeting System
You can direct commands to specific bots using the `[Target]` argument:
1.  **Bot Name**: Affects a single bot (e.g., `SteveBot`).
2.  **Group Name**: Affects a custom group (e.g., `Miners`).
3.  **Archetype**: Affects all bots of a type (e.g., `Protector`).
4.  **`all_aibots`**: Affects every bot you own.

## Safety Protocols

### Homing Beacon & Fleeing
Bots are programmed with a "Homing Beacon" protocol.
*   If a bot becomes "Lost" (pathfinding failure for >60s), it automatically attempts to return to the **Creator's Bed**.
*   When the Creator sets a new spawn point (by sleeping), all bots update their internal compass.
*   The `!flee` command manually triggers this "Return Home" logic with high priority, ignoring combat.

### Idle Behavior
To make bots feel more alive, they perform micro-animations when idle:
*   Looking around randomly.
*   Swinging their main hand.
*   Crouching/Sneaking occasionally.

### Creator Loyalty
*   Bots will ignore chat commands from other players, even if they are OP.
*   Bots will defend the Creator if the Creator is attacked by another player or mob.
